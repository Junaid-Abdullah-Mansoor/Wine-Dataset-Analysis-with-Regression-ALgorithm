# Wine Dataset Analysis with Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing information about different types of wine, including red, rose, sparkling, and white wine. The dataset provides insights into the production, popularity, and consumption patterns of these wines, which can be valuable for wine producers, sellers, and enthusiasts. The project involves applying linear regression, lasso regression, and ridge regression techniques to gain further understanding and make predictions based on the dataset.

## Types of Wine
The project provides an overview of the four main types of wine:
- Red Wine: Made from red or black grapes, fermented with the grape skins to give it a red color. Typically served at room temperature and pairs well with red meat and hearty dishes.
- Rose Wine: Made from a combination of red and white grapes, with the grape skin in contact with the juice for a short time to create a pinkish color. Usually served chilled and popular during the summer.
- Sparkling Wine: Carbonated and has bubbles, made using methods similar to champagne. Often associated with celebrations and toasting.
- White Wine: Made from white or green grapes, fermented without the grape skins. Usually served chilled and pairs well with fish, chicken, and light dishes.

Understanding the characteristics of these wine types helps in selecting the appropriate wine for different occasions and meals.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes four separate datasets, one for each wine category. Each dataset contains the following columns:
- Name: The name of the wine.
- Country: The country where the wine is produced.
- Region: The specific region within the country where the wine is produced.
- Winery: The winery or vineyard that produces the wine.
- Rating: The rating or score assigned to the wine.
- Number of Ratings: The number of ratings or reviews received by the wine.
- Price: The price of the wine.
- Year: The year of production.

## Regression Analysis
Regression analysis is performed on the wine dataset using three different techniques:
1. Linear Regression: A statistical analysis method used to predict the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship and estimates the coefficients of the regression equation using the least squares method.

2. Lasso Regression: A regression analysis method that performs variable selection and regularization. It helps identify important variables and reduce overfitting in datasets with a large number of variables. Lasso regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression equation, encouraging certain variable coefficients to be reduced to zero.

3. Ridge Regression: Another regression analysis method for variable selection and regularization. Ridge regression adds a squared term to the coefficients of the variables, unlike Lasso regression's absolute value term. It is suitable for situations with many small coefficients.

Each regression method has its strengths and weaknesses, and they are useful in different scenarios. Linear regression is a good starting point, while Lasso and Ridge regression address specific issues such as variable selection and regularization.

## Results
The results of the regression analysis show that the mean square error for all three regression algorithms is 0.08, indicating the accuracy of the predictions made using these methods. Further analysis and interpretation of the results can provide valuable insights into the relationships between variables and potential patterns within the wine dataset.

## Disclaimer
Please note that the analysis performed in this project is based on the provided wine dataset and the assumptions made during the regression analysis. The accuracy and reliability of the results depend on the quality and completeness of the dataset. It is recommended to consider other credible sources and expert opinions when making decisions or drawing conclusions based on the analysis.
